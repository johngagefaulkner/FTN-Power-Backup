## Linking console account to epicgames account to get an EPIC NAME
#### __note that the shown name while playing on console is not your epic name__
1. open "https://www.epicgames.com/id/login"
2. login with a **console** account (`PSN` or `XBOX`)
3. in general settings find `Account Info`
4. find `Display Name` under `ID` label
5. `edit/define` `Display Name` value with a new epic name **don't worry, it doesn't change the console name, it will only show playing on the PC**
6. then save the changes
7. after awhile use `new Epic Name` on **FTN Power** like `f.name <epic name>`
